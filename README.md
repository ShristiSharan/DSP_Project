## Multi-stage sleep classification using photoplethysmographic sensor:

This project aims to develop a novel approach for classifying sleep stages using photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor data. PPG sensors measure blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue, providing valuable physiological information that can be utilized for sleep stage classification. Unlike traditional polysomnography (PSG), which requires cumbersome setups and electrodes attached to the body, PPG sensors offer a non-invasive and more comfortable alternative.
